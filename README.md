# ImgSplitter
Cuts a provided image into many smaller images. I wrote this at the same time as I wrote Original Campaign for the Nintendo DS, because it made splitting up large character sheets or sprite sheets into individual files much faster, easier and less tedious to do. 

This project is meant to be ran from the command line by entering 'java ImgSplitter'
